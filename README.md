# my karaoke playlist!

<div><p>The site uses <b>HTML, CSS, JS, and React</b> for the user interface, <b>React Router V6</b> to implement client-side routing, <b>Spotify Web API</b> for authorization and music features, and <b>Cheerio</b> to scrape full lyrics from Musixmatch with an option to avoid web scraping by using the official Musixmatch lyrics API (although this only provides 30% of a song's lyrics).</p>

<p>The site uses a CORS proxy server to allow secure API requests. The proxy server was implemented by me using <b>Express</b> and can be found here: https://github.com/ramitbratabiswas/cors-proxy.</p>

<p>The album collage banner was generated using my own album collage maker: https://github.com/ramitbratabiswas/album-collage-maker</p></div>

my karaoke playlist! lets you find lyrics for your favourite music and displays them all in one page.

You can log in to Spotify to view your own playlists, queue, recents, and top songs.

Or, alternatively, you could just use at Spotify's most popular playlists without logging in :)

The website is also fully responsive, so you get the same experience regardless of what device you use.
