    lyrics: `Hey babe all I want is to be loved by you
But you would never take me as I am it's true
소중한 우리 사이가 멀어질까봐
멀어질까봐
I don't know
Oh 마음처럼
뭐라고 하면 날 떠나버릴까봐 no
나를 밀다 땡겼다 하는 너
그렇게라도 나랑 있는게 난 좋아 no
참는데도 한계가 있어
이제는 더 이상 못참겠다는 말야 yeah
그니까 날 좀 똑바로 봐봐
진심으로 너만 바라보잖아
싫음 싫다고 얼른 말해 바보야
계속 기다리게 하지마 Goodbye
생각보다 내가 너무 여린 가봐
이런 게임은 내가 무조건 져 난
몰라 몰라, 사랑이란
모르겠으니까, 장난 좀 치지마
알면서도 모르는척은 또 뭐야
울고 웃게하는 너도 참 나빠
몰라 몰라, 사랑이란
모르겠으니까, 장난 좀 치지마
장난 좀 치지마
하지마 하지마
장난 좀 치지마
Over this game of love
알면서도 모르는척은 또 뭐야
울고 웃게하는 너도 참 나빠
몰라 몰라, 사랑이란
모르겠으니까, 장난 좀 치지마
밀다 땡겼다 하는 너

    artist: ['PinkPantheress'],
    lyrics: `Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Every time I think of you
The DJ hit me right there (right there)
Said he loved me right there (right there)
Shouted, "Shake it" (shake it)
I ninety-nine percent can't move my waistline
Come sit with me, right there (right there)
Maybe kiss me, right there (right there)
I'm not faking
A good time with you, that's what I want tonight
Why, just show your devotion
Let yourself to the motions
I hate going out, but you just got the promotion
You go to this club
You sing along to look social
To your favorite song
You just make me wanna say, "Hey, it's me" (hey, it's me)
We've been talking twice a week (we've been talking twice a week)
I like this beat (I like this beat)
It just makes me wanna sing (it just makes me wanna sing, turn it up)
"Hey, it's me" (hey, it's me)
We've been talking twice a week (we've been talking twice a week)
I like this beat (I like this beat)
It just makes me wanna sing (it just makes me wanna sing)
Oh, Maria (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Maria (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, Maria (every time I think of you)
I won't tell them I met you in the club (club, club, club)
You remember our favorite song was playing
And every word that came out your mouth was wrong
Oh, Maria, Maria
Tell me why you're always here at night? (Turn it up)
It seems to me it's the only time I see ya
And when I thought I found purpose in my life
You're not here
You just make me wanna say, "Hey, it's me" (hey, it's me)
We've been talking twice a week (we've been talking twice a week)
I like this beat (I like this beat)
It just makes me wanna sing (it just makes me wanna sing, turn it up)
"Hey, it's me" (hey, it's me)
We've been talking twice a week (we've been talking twice a week)
I like this beat (I like this beat)
It just makes me wanna sing (it just makes me wanna sing)
Maria (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, Maria (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Maria (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Every time I think of you, Maria
(Oh Maria, Maria)`

    artist: ['Lexie Liu'],
    lyrics: `花 褪去花瓣
梦随梦消散在梦里
哼 我自己的歌
写给你的音符藏不住
躺在你身边
怎么睡得着
牵你不松手
Okay, okay, okay
原来爱可以很简单
We can float and listen
Okay, okay, okay
不需要找什么答案
Let's just flow endlessly
I wanna love you 'cause I just can't help to
I wanna kiss you but is that gon' be an issue?
'Cause you have heard enough of this
'Cause you have heard enough of this
I wanna tell you how much I do miss you
I wanna tell you everything but I do miss you
'Cause you have heard enough of this
'Cause you have heard enough of this
I know, I know, I know you'vе heard it
I know you've heard a million timеs now
Love, is it a crime?
Killing my pride so tenderly
哼 没节奏的歌
呼吸偷走心跳的舞步
躺在你身边
怎么睡得着
牵你不松手
Okay, okay, okay
原来爱可以很简单
We can float and listen
Okay, okay, okay
不需要找什么答案
Let's just flow endlessly
I wanna love you 'cause I just can't help to
I wanna kiss you but is that gon' be an issue?
'Cause you have heard enough of this
'Cause you have heard enough of this
I wanna tell you how much I do miss you
I wanna tell you everything but I do miss you
'Cause you have heard enough of this
'Cause you have heard enough of this`

    song: 'Please Please Please',
    artist: ['Sabrina Carpenter'],
    lyrics: `I know I have good judgment, I know I have good taste
It's funny and it's ironic that only I feel that way
I promise 'em that you're different and everyone makes mistakes
But just don't
I heard that you're an actor, so act like a stand-up guy
Whatever devil's inside you, don't let him out tonight
I tell them it's just your culture and everyone rolls their eyes
Yeah, I know
All I'm asking, baby

Please, please, please
Don't prove I'm right
And please, please, please
Don't bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing, my ego's another
I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker, oh
Please, please, please (Ah)

Well, I have a fun idea, babe (Uh-huh), maybe just stay inside
I know you're cravin' some fresh air, but the ceiling fan is so nice (It's so nice, right?)
And we could live so happily if no one knows that you're with me
I'm just kidding, but really (Kinda), really, really

Please, please, please (Please don't prove I'm right)
Don't prove I'm right
And please, please, please
Don't bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing (Heartbreak is one thing), my ego's another (Ego's another)
I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker, oh
Please, please, please (Ah)

If you wanna go and be stupid
Don't do it in front of me
If you don't wanna cry to my music
Don't make me hate you prolifically
Please, please, please (Please)
Please, please, please (Please)
Please (Please), please (Please), please
(Ah)`

    song: 'Good Luck, Babe!',
    artist: ['Chappell Roan'],
    lyrics: `It's fine, it's cool
You can say that we are nothing, but you know the truth
And guess I'm the fool
With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof
I don't wanna call it off
But you don't wanna call it love
You only wanna be the one that I call "baby"
You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
I'm cliché, who cares?
It's a sexually explicit kind of love affair
And I cry, it's not fair
I just need a little lovin', I just need a little air
Think I'm gonna call it off
Even if you call it love
I just wanna love someone who calls me "baby"
You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
When you wake up next to him in the middle of the night
With your head in your hands, you're nothing more than his wife
And when you think about me, all of those years ago
You're standing face to face with "I told you so"
You know I hate to say, "I told you so"
You know I hate to say, but, I told you so
You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling (well, I told you so)
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling`
